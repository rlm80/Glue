<h2>Query building</h2>

<p>A query builder makes it possible to write queries as a sequence of function calls rather than by string manipulation. Such a system comes in handy if you want : </p>

<ul>
  <li>Database independance : you want your application to be portable across various database backends.</li>
  <li>Dynamic queries : you need queries that are assembled at runtime according to some logic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fragments</h2>

<p>Queries are represented as trees of data structures called <b>fragments</b>.

<p>There is a fragment class for each piece that makes up an SQL query, for example boolean expressions, boolean operands, join expressions, order by clause and so on. All fragment classes inherit from <span class="inline_code">\Glue\DB\Fragment</span> which means that they all share some common attributes :</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <span class="inline_code">public function sql(Connection $cn = null)</span> function : </li>
  <li>A <span class="inline_code">protected $sql</span> property : </li>
  <li>A <span class="inline_code">protected $users</span> property : </li>
  <li>A <span class="inline_code">protected $context</span> property : </li>
</ul>
