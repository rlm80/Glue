<h2>Fragments</h2>

<p>Queries are represented as <b>trees</b> of <b>fragments</b>.</p>

<p>Fragments are objects that hold data about specific pieces of SQL. Boolean expressions, boolean operands, order by clauses, join expressions and even queries, all of these are represented as fragments. Fragment classes may be found in the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/rlm80/Glue/tree/master/classes/system/db/fragment"><span class="inline_code">classes/system/db/fragment/</span></a> folder.</p>

<h3>Compiling fragments</h3>

<p>Fragments can be compiled into SQL strings according to the SQL dialect of a specific connection by passing them to the <span class="inline_code">-&gt;compile()</span> function of that connection :</p>

  // Build query :
  $query = db::select('users', $u)->where("$u->login = 'Mike'")->columns($u->login);
  
  // Compile data structure against default connection to view generated SQL :
  echo db::cn()->compile($query);
