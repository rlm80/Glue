<h2>Basic fragments</h2>

<p>This page describes all the fragment types that you may have to create explicitely or to directly interact with. There are <a class="external" href="https://github.com/rlm80/Glue/tree/master/classes/system/db/fragment">many other fragment classes</a>, but most of them do not show up through the API, or are derived types of the ones presented here.</p>

<p>Queries are also fragments, but they are described in their own pages.</p>
