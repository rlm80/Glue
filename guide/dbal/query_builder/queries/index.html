<h2>Queries</h2>

<p>Queries are fragments that represent a whole SQL statement : <a href="/Glue/guide/dbal/query_builder/queries/select.html">select</a>, <a href="/Glue/guide/dbal/query_builder/queries/delete.html">delete</a>, <a href="/Glue/guide/dbal/query_builder/queries/update.html">update</a> and <a href="/Glue/guide/dbal/query_builder/queries/insert.html">insert</a>. Each query object aggregates one or more of the builders described in the previous chapter. The API of a query object is mostly the union of the APIs of the builders it aggregates.</p>

<p>There is no support for queries that alter the database schema such as create, drop or alter.</p>
