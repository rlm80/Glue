<p>This fragment represents a boolean expression. It aggregates a list of boolean operands, each with its own connector (or, and). The whole expression can also be negated.</p>

<p>The SQL output of a boolean expression is the SQL output of each of its operands (connector included) put one after the other, preceded with NOT and surrounded with parentheses if the expression is negated.</p>
