<h2>Template fragments</h2>

<p>Low-level elements like operands in boolean expressions can be a complex mix of arithmetic expressions, string concatenations, operators and functions. There is little point in keeping track of their internal structure, and it would be tedious to describe them as a tree of objects.</p>

<p>It is best to consider low-level elements as atomic, and describe them in SQL. Still, straight SQL cannot be used, since database independence would be lost. That is why "<b>pseudo SQL</b>" is introduced.</p>

<h3>Pseudo SQL</h3>

<p>Pseudo SQL is SQL code standardized in such a way that it can easily be converted into proprietary SQL, and its special characters don't need to be escaped in double-quoted PHP strings.</p>

<h4>String literals and identifiers</h4>

<p>String literals and identifiers must be quoted according to the following conventions :</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>String literals</b> : surrounded by simple quotes ('), escape character = simple quote (so my'test becomes 'my''test').</li>
  <li><b>Identifiers</b> : surrounded by backticks (`), escape character = backtick (so my`test becomes `my``test`).</li>
</ul>

<p>When the query is compiled, a regexp is used to detect strings quoted as described above. They are then re-quoted according to the conventions of the underlying RDBMS.</p>

<p>Fortunately, thanks to replacements and table fragments (see below), you won't need to explicitely quote anything most of the time.</p>

<h4>Operators, functions and pre-defined constants</h4>

<p>At the moment the library doesn't impose any naming conventions. What's important is to be consistent accross the whole application.</p>

<p>A hook ( <span class="inline_code">Connection::hook_sql_replace()</span> ) is provided so that you can implement your own name conversions from pseudo SQL to proprietary SQL for a specific connection. The hook only operates between string literals and identifiers, so there is no risk of unfortunate matches occurring inside of those.</p>
