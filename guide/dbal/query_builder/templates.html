<p>Low-level elements like operands in boolean expressions can be a complex mix of arithmetic expressions, string concatenations, operators and functions. There is little point in keeping track of their internal structure, and it would be tedious to describe them as a tree of objects.</p>

<p>It is best to consider low-level elements as atomic, and describe them in SQL. Still, straight SQL cannot be used, since database independence would be lost. That is why "<b>pseudo SQL</b>" is introduced.</p>

<h3>Pseudo SQL</h3>

<p>Pseudo SQL is SQL code standardized in such a way that it can easily be converted into proprietary SQL, and its special characters don't need to be escaped in double-quoted PHP strings.</p>

<h4>String literals and identifiers</h4>

<p>String literals must be surrounded by simple quotes (') and identifiers by backticks (`). The escape mechanism is described <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Padding_quoting_delimiters">here</a> (e.g. string literal <i>my'test</i> becomes <i>'my''test'</i>, identifier <i>my`test</i> becomes <i>`my``test`</i>). Fortunately, thanks to replacements and table fragments (see below), you won't need to explicitely quote anything most of the time.</p>

<h4>Operators, functions and pre-defined constants</h4>

<p>The library doesn't impose any naming conventions. What's important is to be consistent accross the whole application. A hook ( <span class="inline_code">Connection::hook_sql_replace()</span> ) is provided so that you can implement your own name conversions from pseudo SQL to proprietary SQL for a specific connection (the hook only operates between string literals and identifiers, so there is no risk of unfortunate matches occurring inside of those).</p>
