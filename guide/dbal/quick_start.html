<h2>Quick start guide</h2>

<p>This is a simple cookbook to get started quickly. For explanations and details, refer the the rest of the guide.</p>

<h3>Database configuration</h3>

<p>Assuming you're using MySQL, edit the following file and replace the connection parameters with your own :</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
  // File classes/user/db/connection/default.php
  
  namespace Glue\User\DB;

  class Connection_Default extends \Glue\DB\Connection_MySQL {
    protected $dbname   = 'test'; // Change this
    protected $username = 'root'; // Change this
    protected $password = '';     // Change this
  }
?>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Using your database connection as a PDO instance</h3>

<p>The entry point into everything DBAL-related is the static methods of the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/rlm80/Glue/blob/master/classes/system/db/db.php"><span class="inline_code">\Glue\DB\DB</span></a> class. Calling <span class="inline_code">DB::cn()</span> will return a singleton instance of the Connection class that you defined above. You may use that object like you would use any other PDO instance, since that's what it actually is.</p>

<p>For example :</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
  // Import the \Glue\DB\DB class into the current file, so that you can refer to it as simply "DB" :
  use Glue\DB\DB;
    
  try {
    // Issue query :
    $statement = DB::cn()->query("SELECT name FROM fruits");
    
    // Display results :
    foreach($statement as $row)
      echo $row[0] . "\n";
  }
  catch (PDOException $e) {
    // Deal with errors :
    echo $e->getMessage();
  }
?>
{% endhighlight %}
