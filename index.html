<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The code discussed here is experimental. Development may or may not continue in the future. Take a look around, judge for yourself and use at your own risk.</p>

<h2>What it is</h2>

<p>This is a combination of two projects :</p>

<ul>
	<li>a database abstraction library that extends <a class="external" href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php">PDO</a>,</li>
	<li>an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">object relational mapping</a> library based on the <a class="external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html">data mapper pattern</a> (<i>in the works, not available yet</i>).
</ul>

<h2>Database abstraction library</h2>

<p>For the most part this is a <b>query builder</b> that makes it possible to compose queries as a sequence of PHP function calls, rather than manipulating SQL code as strings :</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
	$stmt = db::select('users', $u)
            ->columns($u->password, $u->email)
            ->where("$u->login = ?", 'Mike');
?>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>There are two benefits in writing SQL queries this way :</p>

<ul>
  <li>queries are portable accross various database backends,</li>
  <li>queries can be composed bits by bits, in no particular order.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Object relational mapping library (not available yet)</h2>

<p>The <b>ORM</b> is built on top of the DBAL. It makes it possible to manipulate model objects only, never having to worry about the way they are stored into, and retrieved from, the database.</p>
