<h2>Query builder</h2>

<p>The point of a query builder is not to make writing queries easier or faster.</p>

<p>A query builder makes it possible to write queries as a sequence of function calls rather than by string manipulation. Such a system comes in handy if you want : </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Database independance</b> - you want your application to be portable across various database backends.</li>
  <li><b>Dynamic queries</b> - you need queries that are assembled at runtime according to some logic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
	$query = db::select('users', $u)
                ->columns($u->login, $u->password)
                ->where("$u->login LIKE ?", 'abc%')
                ->orderby($u->login)
                ->root();
?>
{% endhighlight %}
